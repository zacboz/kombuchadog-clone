Introduction

About the Project

Kombuchadog Clone is a Full Stack (SQL, Express, Angular, Node) web application. It is a fully functional and responsive clone of kombuchadog.com, a beautifully designed eCommerce site that sells homemade kombucha and features rescued dogs in need of a home on the label. You can view all the dogs and read their stories on the site. You can also buy tee shirts decorated with high quality images of some of these very special canines. The kombucha bottles are only sold at unique local vendors in Southern California.
